# Zombocalypse Overdrive

This was our first time working with godot, and really game creation in general, so we didn't get quite as much done as we would have hoped.

The final version by the end of the hackathon Has the tower logic and movement implemented, zombies will move along the track, and the towers will attack them and do damage as well as eventually kill them, there are 3 types of zombies with varying speeds and health values, but the game is missing most UI/player interaction elements, as we did not have time to implement tower placements, a currency system, level select, etc.
